This repo presents a bilevel decomposition approach  to a predictive model control (MPC) for dynamic systems coupled by resource constraints. The implemented proposal has a hierarchical structure of bilevel decomposition, which results in the same solution that would be obtained by a centralized controller, demonstrating a better computational robustness than the centralized fashion. It is also shown that this decomposition allows computional parallelization. Numerical experiments with synthetic but representative systems are presented and discussed, wich led to draw conclusions about the benefits obtained from the use of Julia programming language for the implementation of the algorithm and its potential for future work.
